## Tomato Disease detection with CNN and Transfer Learning 

• Developed a CNN-based model for accurate tomato plant disease detection.

• Dataset contains tomato leaf 16011 images belonging to 10 classes.

• Implemented image pre-processing techniques including resizing and reshaping for efficient model training.

• Utilized TensorFlow data pipeline to optimize memory usage during image data processing.

• Designed a 6-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract informative features from pre-processed tomato
leaf images.

• Leveraged transfer learning with EfficientNet B0 to achieve high accuracy in disease detection from a dataset
containing healthy and diseased tomato leaf images (9 disease classes).
